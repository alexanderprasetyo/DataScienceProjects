## Credit Card Default Prediction

The data used in this task was taken from Machine Learning Datasets in BigQuery Google Public Dataset. A Taiwan-based credit card issuer wants to better predict the likelihood of default for its customers, as well as identify the key drivers that determine this likelihood. This would inform the issuerâ€™s decisions on who to give a credit card to and what credit limit to provide. It would also help the issuer have a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted credit products to their customers.
Machine Learning methods in this projects are:
- LogisticRegression
- KNeighborsClassifier
- GaussianNB
- DecisionTreeClassifier

## Customer Churn Prediction

The dataset used in this project is available in the Kaggle (CC BY-NC-ND) and contains twenty columns (independent variables) that indicate the characteristics of the clients of a fictional telecommunications corporation. The Churn column (response variable) indicates whether the customer departed within the last month or not. The class No includes the clients that did not leave the company last month, while the class Yes contains the clients that decided to terminate their relations with the company.
In this project I used machine learning and deep learning methods, here are the list:
1. Machine Learning:
* LogisticRegression
* KNeighborsClassifier
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* RandomForestClassifier
* SVC
* AdaBoostClassifier
* GradientBoostingClassifier
* XGBClassifier

2. Deep Learning:
* Sequential API
* Functional API

## German Traffic Road Sign Prediction

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. This dataset is provided to be analyzed and developed into each analyzer creativity. In the dataset contains the following properties:
- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike databasa

All the images are traffic sign in Germany, there are 42 types/class of traffic sign and varies from speed limit sign, no passing sign, no vehicle sign, go straight or left, etc.
In this project, I used CNN to make the deep learning model.
